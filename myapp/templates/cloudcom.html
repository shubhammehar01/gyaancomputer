                    <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
                    <p>A public cloud is a type of cloud computing where the computing resources are owned and operated
                        by a third-party provider and made available to the general public over the internet. Users can
                        access the services on a pay-per-use or subscription basis. Public clouds are often used for
                        non-sensitive, low-cost applications.</p>
                    <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
                    <p>A private cloud is a type of cloud computing where the computing resources are owned and operated
                        by a single organization or entity. Private clouds are typically used by large enterprises or
                        government agencies that require greater control over their computing infrastructure and data.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                    <p>A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines elements of public and private clouds.
                        This allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both types of clouds, while also
                        addressing their specific needs for security, compliance, and control.</p>
                    <h3>Multi-Cloud</h3>
                    <p>A multi-cloud is a type of cloud computing that involves using two or more cloud computing
                        services from different providers. This allows organizations to avoid vendor lock-in, increase
                        redundancy and resilience, and leverage the strengths of each provider's offerings.</p>
                    <p>Each type of cloud computing has its own advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the right
                        type depends on factors such as security requirements, budget, scalability needs, and workload
                        characteristics.</p>
