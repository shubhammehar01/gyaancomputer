                    </header>
                    <p>Quantum computing is a new type of computing that is based on the principles of quantum
                        mechanics. It uses qubits (quantum bits) instead of classical bits to perform calculations.
                        This allows for certain types of calculations to be performed much faster than with
                        classical computers.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at
                        the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It is a very different way of
                        looking at the world compared to classical physics, which is based on the laws of mechanics
                        developed by Isaac Newton in the 17th century.</p>

                        <h2>How Does Quantum Computing Work?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Quantum computing works by using qubits, which can be in a state of superposition and
                        entanglement. Superposition means that a qubit can be in multiple states at the same time,
                        whereas entanglement means that two qubits can be connected in a way that their states are
                        dependent on each other.</p>
                    <p>Quantum algorithms take advantage of these properties to perform certain types of
                        calculations much faster than classical algorithms. For example, the famous Shor's algorithm
                        can factor large numbers much faster than classical algorithms, which has important
                        implications for cryptography.</p>

                        <h2>Potential Applications</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize many fields, such as cryptography, drug
                        discovery, and optimization problems. For example, it could be used to design new drugs much
                        faster than with classical computers, or to optimize logistics and transportation networks.

                        <h2>Limitations</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Quantum computing is still in its early stages and there are many challenges that need to be
                        overcome before it can become a practical technology. One of the biggest challenges is the
                        issue of quantum decoherence, which causes qubits to lose their coherence over time and make
                        calculations unreliable.</p>
