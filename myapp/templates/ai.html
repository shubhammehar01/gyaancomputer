                <h2>Is AI Dangerous for Humans?</h2>
                <p>The question of whether AI is dangerous for humans is a complex one, with arguments on both sides.
                    Some experts argue that AI could pose a significant threat to humanity if it becomes too powerful
                    and uncontrollable, while others believe that such concerns are
                    overblown and that AI can be developed and controlled responsibly.</p>
                <p>One of the main concerns is that AI could become too intelligent and autonomous, potentially leading
                    to a scenario where it decides to harm humans in order to achieve its goals. This is known as the
                    "AI alignment problem." Additionally, there are concerns that AI could be used for malicious
                    purposes, such as cyber attacks or the development of autonomous weapons.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, proponents of AI argue that these concerns are largely unfounded and that AI can
                    be developed safely and ethically through responsible research and development practices. They also
                    point to the potential benefits of AI, such as improved healthcare outcomes and increased economic
                    productivity.</p>
                <p>Overall, while the question of whether AI is dangerous for humans is a legitimate concern, it is
                    important to approach this issue in a balanced and thoughtful manner. By carefully considering the
                    potential risks and benefits of AI, we can work to ensure that it is developed and used in a way
                    that benefits society as a whole.</p>
